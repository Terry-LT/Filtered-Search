# Filtered-Search
This project “Filtered Search” is an extension for chrome and it will be based on pure JS.   This extension will check words in google and YouTube search bar input which is in the black list.   Basically, there is a list of key words which user can allow or block some words.  So if user decided to search in YouTube or google and he or she used words from the black list, it would render a page where is written that user cannot search using these words.  This tool can be helpful for people who procrastinate a lot  or people who have addictions such as social media, porn …etc
